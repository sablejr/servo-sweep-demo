# Servo Sweep Demo

## Overview
This project demonstrates **real-time control of a servo motor** using an Arduino Uno. The SG90 servo sweeps smoothly back and forth from 0° to 180°, with angles printed to the Serial Monitor.  

It showcases fundamental **embedded software skills**, including:

- PWM signal control for actuators  
- Real-time loop handling and timing  
- Serial debugging and logging  
- Hardware interfacing and wiring

This project is a starting point for more complex embedded systems applications.
